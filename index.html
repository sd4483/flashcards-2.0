            <p class="card-content">
                Paper flashcards have been used since at least the 19th century, with Reading Disentangled (1834), 
                a set of phonics flashcards by English educator Favell Lee Mortimer being credited by some as the first flashcards.

                Why were flashcards invented?
            </h3>
            <p class="card-content">
                Students who couldn't even afford a single book could afford flashcards that allowed them to learn easily 
                on their own outside of the formal classroom. This method was encouraged to spread across schools for the poor 
                by educational pioneer Joseph Lancaster due to his influential 1805 book Improvements in Education.

                When did flashcards become popular?
            </h3>
            <p class="card-content">
                The first copyright for “flash cards” was filed in 1908, and magazines in the 1920s capitalized on the 
                new educational trend and began including flashcard sets for various subjects, including phonics and spelling, 
                as part of their offerings.16-Apr-2017

                What is the theory behind flashcards?
            </h3>
            <p class="card-content">
                Flash cards are strategically designed to enhance and encourage active recall. 
                The format, usually a question on one side of the card and the answer on the other, requires learners to look 
                at one side and recall the information from the other side.

                What are active learning methods?
            </h3>
            <p class="card-content">
                Active learning methods ask students to engage in their learning by thinking, discussing, 
                investigating, and creating. In class, students practice skills, solve problems, struggle with complex questions, 
                make decisions, propose solutions, and explain ideas in their own words through writing and discussion.
